Do you longingly reminisce about the days when flying toasters graced your screen? Do words like "Confetti Factory" and "Daredevil Dan" make your heart skip a beat?

If so, then never fear --- CSS is here! Using modern CSS techniques like animations and transforms, we can imitate several of your favorite After Dark™ screensavers.
